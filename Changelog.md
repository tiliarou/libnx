## Version 1.4.0

#### system
* **Added support for C11 threads**, which are preemptively multitasked and load balanced across cores.
* **Added Event object**, which wraps kernel revent/wevent handles with optional autoclear.
* **Changed CondVar interface** to have the mutex be passed to condvarWait* instead of condvarInit, which is consistent with both the concept of a condition variable and with other common threading APIs.
* Added armGetSystemTick (which supersedes svcGetSystemTick), and armGetSystemTickFreq.
* Added rwlockInit.
* Added kernelAbove600.
* Added system calls: svcGetThreadCoreMask, svcSetThreadCoreMask.
* Added MOD0 header to binaries compiled with libnx.
* Fixed semaphoreTryWait.
* Fixed a memory leak in tmemCreate.

#### services
* Added bpc service (used for rebooting and shutting down the console).
* Added psm service (needed to get the battery status).
* Added ns commands: nsListApplicationRecord, nsListApplicationContentMetaStatus.
* Minor enhancements to applet service:
  * Added missing AppletType_SystemApplet initialization in applet code.
  * Added appletBeginBlockingHomeButton and appletEndBlockingHomeButton.
* The Event object is now used to return system events from service wrappers when possible, also providing the correct autoclear mode.
* Corrected fsOpenFileSystem and fsOpenFileSystemWithId.
* Corrected a bug in hidInitializeVibrationDevices.
* Corrected a bug in socket error conversion.
* Fixed nifm not initializing properly for < 3.0.0.
* Service manager (sm) session now closes properly.
* hid, irs, vi and nv services now acquire a reference to applet services.

#### audio
* **Added audren:u** service wrapper (presently requiring 3.0.0+, will be addressed in a future update).
* **Added AudioDriver** wrapper around audren, providing a higher level interface that can be used to mix and play sounds.

#### graphics
* **Major rewrite and refactoring work in the gfx wrapper** which brings reliability and usability improvements:
  * **Removed GfxMode_TiledSingle** mode due to it causing problems and potential (temporary) hardware damage.
  * **The default transform behavior no longer vertically flips the framebuffer**.
  * **Removed gfxSetDrawFlip** since it's no longer needed thanks to the change in the default transform behavior.
  * **It is not necessary to call gfxWaitForVsync in most situations** because gfxSwapBuffers already implicitly synchronizes with the display (this is mandated by the Android surface compositor and buffer producer system).
  * **Dequeue fatal errors should be solved**.
  * Simplified and streamlined logic.
  * nvgfx stripped down to the minimum that is actually necessary to allocate framebuffers.
  * Binder logic now more closely matches both Android code and official software.
  * Proper fence and event wait code is now used.
* **Console code no longer performs a forced flush/swap/vblank wait when printing a newline** due to performance reasons. Users of the console device must make sure that gfxFlushBuffers and gfxSwapBuffers are periodically called, preferably in the main loop of the application.
* **Added experimental wrapper objects for the Nvidia driver**, needed in order to use the GPU. These wrappers are still in RE phase and will be subject to change in a future release.
* **Major redesign of the VI service wrapper** that allows future users to use VI directly to create a display layer.
* Binder services & buffer producer wrappers were enhanced and redesigned.
  * Binder now holds less state and always uses the VI binder relay service session.
  * Added Module_LibnxBinder error codes.
  * IGraphicBufferProducer binder service wrappers now have the `bq` prefix and explicitly accept a Binder object.
  * Added bqCancelBuffer.
  * bqGraphicBufferInit was renamed to bqSetPreallocatedBuffer.
* Enhancements and additions to nvidia ioctl wrappers.
* Added definitions for some more Android enumerations.

#### miscellaneous
* The `ALIGN` macro was removed in favor of the C11/C++11 alignas attribute.
* Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments to enhance the user experience.
